QUESTION 1: How many hashes did you use as FindMinHash's parameter to achieve a 30 to 45 second runtime: 

Number of Hashes (example: 750,000,000): 270,000,000
Number of Seconds (example: 30.870s): 36.451s

Note: We're only interested in the "real" seconds for this question.


QUESTION 2: Provide the full ``time`` output for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. **Ensure that the result is identical for all 16 runs.** You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like (replace 750000000 with your Number of Hashes from QUESTION 1): 

``for i in {1..16} ; do time java FindMinHash 750000000 $i ; done``

Example Timing (first 2 of 16 runs only on Antares):

ricegf@antares$ for i in {1..16} ; do time java FindMinHash 750000000 $i ; done

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?
Adding more threads speeds up the program.



QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?




BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Time your thread pool version of FindMinHash as you did for the full credit version. Is a thread pool faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? 


YOUR Timing:




QUESTION 6: Compare the full credit and bonus solutions. Which do you believe is more supportable over a long lifetime of evolving hardware and environments?
